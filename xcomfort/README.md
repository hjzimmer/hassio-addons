[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-41BDF5.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/hacs/integration)




This is a modification of the Addon of Karl Oygard and lets your hassio talk with the Xcomfort ECI (CCIA-0x/01) or Xcomfort USB (CKOZ-00/14) to control multiple Xcomfort actors and switches. 
For a full ist, see Karl's githun page.
This modification allows you to use any 3rd party MQTT server, where as Karl's original project only works with the (out of the box) configuration of he native Hassio Mosquitto MQTT broker.

Special thanks to Karl for doing all the hard (base) work, and if you would like to buy him a coffee: feel free to do so with below button:
